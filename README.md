# CIPR-Mind-Map

As a general rule of thumb, I do not support horrid business practices like this. Forcing people to sign up for your service increases risk for all parties involved. Now there is ANOTHER database with ANOTHER email (and sometimes password) that can be breached. If you are providing these services or your organization does stupid marketing stunts like this, please... just stop.
